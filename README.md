# Pepo v2.0.0 Changes

Added spell queuing, automatic retry on error, and quickcasting with lots of customization.  

Some other key improvements over Namreeb's version:
- Using a buffer to avoid server rejections from casting too quickly (namreeb's uses 0 buffer).  See 'Why do I need a buffer?' below for more info.
- Using high_resolution_clock instead of GetTickCount for faster timing on when to start casts
- Fix broken cast animations when casting spells back to back

### Compatability with other addons
Queuing can cause issues with some addons that also manage spell casting.  Quickheal/Healbot/Quiver do not work well with queuing.  Check github issues for other potential incompatibilities.
If someone rewrites these addons to use guids from superwow that would likely fix all issues.

Additionally, if you use pfui mouseover macros there is a timing issue that can occur causing it to target yourself instead of your mouseover target.  <b>If you have superwow and latest pfui issue is fixed</b>.

<b>If you have superwow and use /stcast HIGHLY recommend replacing mods/mouseover.lua with this version</b> https://gist.github.com/pepopo978/625e46ae0e09fe6e9554ca0808c117de

<b>Notgrid</b> mouseover needs to be updated to take advantage of superwow the default version won't work well with queuing.

<b>If you use healcomm can replace all instances of it in your addons with this version to work well with queuing </b> https://github.com/MarcelineVQ/LunaUnitFrames/blob/TurtleWoW/libs/HealComm-1.0/HealComm-1.0.lua (requires superwow).

If all else fails can turn off queuing for a specific macro like so depending on the spell being cast:
```
/run SetCVar("NP_QueueCastTimeSpells", "0")
/run SetCVar("NP_QueueInstantSpells", "0")
/pfcast YOUR_SPELL
/run SetCVar("NP_QueueCastTimeSpells", "1")
/run SetCVar("NP_QueueInstantSpells", "1")
```
### Twow Launcher Installation
Enable Nampower in the mods tabs.

Enable NampowerSettings in the addons tab.

### Manual Installation
Grab the latest nampower.dll from https://github.com/pepopo978/nampower/releases and place in the same directory as WoW.exe.  You can also get the helper addon mentioned below and place that in Interface/Addons.

Add nampower.dll to your dlls.txt file if it isn't already there.

If you would prefer to compile yourself you will need to get:
- boost 1.80 32 bit from https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_80_0.html
- hadesmem from https://github.com/namreeb/hadesmem

CMakeLists.txt is currently looking for boost at `set(BOOST_INCLUDEDIR "C:/software/boost_1_80_0")` and hadesmem at `set(HADESMEM_ROOT "C:/software/hadesmem-v142-Debug-Win32")`.  Edit as needed.

### Configuration

#### Configure with addon
There is a companion addon to make it easy to check/change the settings in game.  You can download it here - [nampowersettings](https://github.com/pepopo978/nampowersettings).

#### Manual Configuration
The following CVars control the behavior of the spell queuing system:

You can access CVars in game with `/run DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(GetCVar("CVarName"))`<br>
and set them with `/run SetCVar("CVarName", "Value")`

You can also just place them in your Config.wtf file in your WTF folder.  If they are the default value they will not be written to the file.
Example:
```
SET EnableMusic "0"
SET MasterSoundEffects "0"

SET NP_QuickcastTargetingSpells "1"
SET NP_SpellQueueWindowMs "1000"
SET NP_TargetingQueueWindowMs "1000"
```

- `NP_QueueCastTimeSpells` - Whether to enable spell queuing for spells with a cast time.  0 to disable, 1 to enable. Default is 1.
- `NP_QueueInstantSpells` - Whether to enable spell queuing for instant cast spells tied to gcd.  0 to disable, 1 to enable.  Default is 1.
- `NP_QueueChannelingSpells` - Whether to enable channeling spell queuing as well as whether to allow any queuing during channels.  0 to disable, 1 to enable. Default is 1.
- `NP_QueueTargetingSpells` - Whether to enable terrain targeting spell queuing.  0 to disable, 1 to enable. Default is 1.
- `NP_QueueOnSwingSpells` - Whether to enable on swing spell queuing.  0 to disable, 1 to enable. Default is 0 (changed with 1.17.2 due to changes to on swing spells).
- `NP_QueueSpellsOnCooldown` - Whether to enable queuing for spells coming off cooldown.  0 to disable, 1 to enable. Default is 1.

- `NP_InterruptChannelsOutsideQueueWindow` - Whether to allow interrupting channels (the original client behavior) when trying to cast a spell outside the channeling queue window. Default is 0.

- `NP_SpellQueueWindowMs` - The window in ms before a cast finishes where the next will get queued. Default is 500.
- `NP_OnSwingBufferCooldownMs` - The cooldown time in ms after an on swing spell before you can queue on swing spells. Default is 500.
- `NP_ChannelQueueWindowMs` - The window in ms before a channel finishes where the next will get queued. Default is 1500.
- `NP_TargetingQueueWindowMs` - The window in ms before a terrain targeting spell finishes where the next will get queued. Default is 500.
- `NP_CooldownQueueWindowMs` - The window in ms of remaining cooldown where a spell will get queued instead of failing with 'Spell not Ready Yet'. Default is 250.


- `NP_MinBufferTimeMs` - The minimum buffer delay in ms added to each cast (covered more below).  The dynamic buffer adjustments will not go below this value. Default is 55.
- `NP_NonGcdBufferTimeMs` - The buffer delay in ms added AFTER each cast that is not tied to the gcd. Default is 100.
- `NP_MaxBufferIncreaseMs` - The maximum amount of time in ms to increase the buffer by when the server rejects a cast. This prevents getting too long of a buffer if you happen to get a ton of rejections in a row. Default is 30.


- `NP_RetryServerRejectedSpells` - Whether to retry spells that are rejected by the server for these reasons: SPELL_FAILED_ITEM_NOT_READY, SPELL_FAILED_NOT_READY, SPELL_FAILED_SPELL_IN_PROGRESS.  0 to disable, 1 to enable. Default is 1.
- `NP_QuickcastTargetingSpells` - Whether to enable quick casting for ALL spells with terrain targeting.  This will cause the spell to instantly cast on your cursor without waiting for you to confirm the targeting circle.  Queuing targeting spells will use quickcasting regardless of this value (couldn't get it to work without doing this).  0 to disable, 1 to enable. Default is 0.
- `NP_ReplaceMatchingNonGcdCategory` - Whether to replace any queued non gcd spell when a new non gcd spell with the same StartRecoveryCategory is cast (more explanation below).  0 to disable, 1 to enable. Default is 0.
- `NP_OptimizeBufferUsingPacketTimings` - Whether to attempt to optimize your buffer using your latency and server packet timings (more explanation below).  0 to disable, 1 to enable. Default is 0.

- `NP_PreventRightClickTargetChange` - Whether to prevent right-clicking from changing your current target when in combat.  If you don't have a target right click will still change your target even with this on.  This is mainly to prevent accidentally changing targets in combat when trying to adjust your camera.  0 to disable, 1 to enable. Default is 0.

- `NP_DoubleCastToEndChannelEarly` - Whether to allow double casting a spell within 350ms to end channeling on the next tick.  Takes into account your ChannelLatencyReductionPercentage.  0 to disable, 1 to enable. Default is 0.

- `NP_ChannelLatencyReductionPercentage` - The percentage of your latency to subtract from the end of a channel duration to optimize cast time while hopefully not losing any ticks (more explanation below). Default is 75.

- `NP_NameplateDistance` - The distance in yards to display nameplates.  Defaults to whatever was set by the game or vanilla tweaks.

### Custom Lua Functions

#### QueueSpellByName(spellName)
Will force queue a spell regardless of the appropriate queue window.  If no spell is currently being cast it will be cast immediately.
For example can make a macro with 
```
/run QueueSpellByName("Frostbolt");QueueSpellByName("Frostbolt")
```
to cast 2 frostbolts in a row.  Currently, can only queue 1 GCD spell at a time and 5 non gcd spells.  This means you can't do 3 frostbolts in a row with one macro.

#### CastSpellByNameNoQueue(spellName)
Will force a spell cast to never queue even if your settings would normally queue.  Can be used to fix addons that don't work with queued spells.

#### QueueScript(script, [priority])
Queues any arbitrary script using the same logic as a regular spell using NP_SpellQueueWindowMs as the window.  If no spell is being cast and you are not on the gcd the script will be run immediately.

Priority is optional and defaults to 1.  
Priority 1 means the script will run before any other queued spells.
Priority 2 means the script will run after any queued non gcd spells but before any queued normal spells.
Priority 3 means the script will run after any type of queued spells.

Convert slash commands from other addons like `/equip` to their function form `SlashCmdList.EQUIP` to use them inside QueueScript.

For example, you can equip a libram before casting a queued heal using
```
/run QueueScript('SlashCmdList.EQUIP("Libram of +heal")')
```

#### IsSpellInRange(spellName, [target]) or IsSpellInRange(spellId, [target])
Takes a spell name or spell id and an optional target.  Target can the usual UNIT tokens like "player", "target", "mouseover", etc or a unit guid.

If using spell name it must be a spell you have in your spellbook.  If using spell id it can be any spell id.

Returns 1 if the spell is in range, 0 if not in range, and -1 if the spell is not valid for this check (must be TARGET_UNIT_PET, TARGET_UNIT_TARGET_ENEMY, TARGET_UNIT_TARGET_ALLY, TARGET_UNIT_TARGET_ANY).
This is because this uses the same underlying function as `IsActionInRange` which returns 1 for spells that are not single target which can be misleading.

Examples:
```
/run local result=IsSpellInRange("Frostbolt"); if result == 1 then print("In range") else if result == 0 then print("Out of range") else print("Not single target") end
```

#### IsSpellUsable(spellName) or IsSpellUsable(spellId)
Takes a spell name or spell id.  

Usable does not equal castable.  This is most often used to check if a reactive spell is usable.

If using spell name it must be a spell you have in your spellbook.  If using spell id it can be any spell id.

Returns: 

1st param: 1 if the spell is usable, 0 if not usable.
2nd param: Always 0 if spell is not usable for a different reason other than mana.  1 if out of mana, 0 if not out of mana.

Examples:
```
/run local result=IsSpellUsable("Frostbolt"); if result == 1 then print("Frostbolt usable") else print("Frostbolt not usable") end
```

#### GetCurrentCastingInfo()
Returns:

1st param: Casting spell id or 0
2nd param: Visual spell id or 0.  This won't always get cleared after a spell finishes.
3rd param: Auto repeating spell id or 0.
4th param: 1 if casting spell with a cast time, 0 if not.
5th param: 1 if channeling, 0 if not.
6th param: 1 if on swing spell is pending, 0 if not.
7th param: 1 if auto attacking, 0 if not.

For normal spells these will be the same.  For some spells like auto-repeating and channeling spells only the visual spell id will be set.

Examples:
```
/run local castId,visId,autoId,casting,channeling,onswing,autoattack=GetCurrentCastingInfo();print(castId);print(visId);print(autoId);print(casting);print(channeling);print(onswing);print(autoattack);
```

#### GetSpellIdForName(spellName)
Returns:

1st param: the max rank spell id for a spell name if it exists in your spellbook.  Returns 0 if the spell is not in your spellbook.

Examples:
```
/run local spellId=GetSpellIdForName("Frostbolt");print(spellId)
/run local spellId=GetSpellIdForName("Frostbolt(Rank 1)");print(spellId)
```

#### GetSpellNameAndRankForId(id)
Returns:

1st param: the spell name for a spell id
2nd param: the spell rank for a spell id as a string such as "Rank 1"

Examples:
```
/run local spellName,spellRank=GetSpellNameAndRankForId(116);print(spellName);print(spellRank)
prints "Frostbolt" and "Rank 1"
```

#### GetSpellSlotTypeIdForName(spellName)
Returns:

1st param: the 1 indexed (lua calls expect this) spell slot number for a spell name if it exists in your spellbook.  Returns 0 if the spell is not in your spellbook.
2nd param: the book type of the spell, either "spell", "pet" or "unknown".
3rd param: the spell id of the spell.  Returns 0 if the spell is not in your spellbook.

Examples:
```
/run local slot, bookType, spellId=GetSpellSlotTypeIdForName("Frostbolt");print(slot);print(bookType);print(spellId)
```

#### GetNampowerVersion()
Returns the current version of Nampower split into major, minor and patch numbers.

So if version was v2.8.6 it would return 2, 8, 6 as integers.

Examples:
```
/run local major, minor, patch=GetNampowerVersion();print(major);print(minor);print(patch)
```

The previous version of this `GetSpellSlotAndTypeForName` was removed as it was returning a 0 indexed slot number which was confusing to use in lua.

#### GetItemLevel(itemId)
Returns the item level of an item.  Returns an error if the item id is invalid.

Examples:
```
/run local itemLevel=GetItemLevel(22589);print(itemLevel)
should print 90 for atiesh
```

#### ChannelStopCastingNextTick()
Will stop channeling early on the next tick if you have queue channeling spells enabled and try to cast a spell before the next tick (didn't know how to cancel channels without casting another spell).  Uses your ChannelLatencyReductionPercentage to determine when to stop the channel.

### Custom Events

#### SPELL_QUEUE_EVENT
I've added a new event you can register in game to get updates when spells are added and popped from the queue.

The event is `SPELL_QUEUE_EVENT` and has 2 parameters:
1.  int eventCode - see below
2.  int spellId

Possible Event codes:
```
 ON_SWING_QUEUED = 0
 ON_SWING_QUEUE_POPPED = 1
 NORMAL_QUEUED = 2
 NORMAL_QUEUE_POPPED = 3
 NON_GCD_QUEUED = 4
 NON_GCD_QUEUE_POPPED = 5
```

Example from NampowerSettings:
```
local ON_SWING_QUEUED = 0
local ON_SWING_QUEUE_POPPED = 1
local NORMAL_QUEUED = 2
local NORMAL_QUEUE_POPPED = 3
local NON_GCD_QUEUED = 4
local NON_GCD_QUEUE_POPPED = 5

local function spellQueueEvent(eventCode, spellId)
	if eventCode == NORMAL_QUEUED or eventCode == NON_GCD_QUEUED then
		local _, _, texture = SpellInfo(spellId) -- superwow function
		Nampower.queued_spell.texture:SetTexture(texture)
		Nampower.queued_spell:Show()
	elseif eventCode == NORMAL_QUEUE_POPPED or eventCode == NON_GCD_QUEUE_POPPED then
		Nampower.queued_spell:Hide()
	end
end

NampowerSettings:RegisterEvent("SPELL_QUEUE_EVENT", spellQueueEvent)
```

#### SPELL_CAST_EVENT
New event you can register in game to get updates when spells are cast with some additional information.

The event is `SPELL_CAST_EVENT` and has 5 parameters:
1.  int success - 1 if cast succeeded, 0 if failed
2.  int spellId
3.  int castType - see below
4.  string targetGuid - guid string like "0xF5300000000000A5"
5.  int itemId - the id of the item that triggered the spell, 0 if it wasn't triggered by an item
 
Possible Cast Types:
```
NORMAL=1
NON_GCD=2
ON_SWING=3
CHANNEL=4
TARGETING=5 (targeting is the term I used for spells with terrain targeting)
TARGETING_NON_GCD=6
```

targetGuid will be "0x000000000" unless an explicit target is specified which currently only happens in 2 circumstances:
- It was specified as the 2nd param of CastSpellByName (added by superwow)
- Mouseover casts that use SpellTargetUnit to specify a target

Example (uses ace RegisterEvent):
```
Cursive:RegisterEvent("SPELL_CAST_EVENT", function(success, spellId, castType, targetGuid, itemId)
	print(success)
	print(spellId)
	print(castType)
	print(targetGuid)
	print(itemId)
end);
```

####  SPELL_DAMAGE_EVENT_SELF and SPELL_DAMAGE_EVENT_OTHER
New events you can register in game to get updates whenever spell damage occurs. SPELL_DAMAGE_EVENT_SELF will only trigger for damage you deal, while SPELL_DAMAGE_EVENT_OTHER will only trigger for damage dealt by others.

Both of these events have the following parameters:
1.  string targetGuid - guid string like "0xF5300000000000A5"
2.  string casterGuid - guid string like "0xF5300000000000A5"
3.  int spellId
4.  int amount - the amount of damage dealt.  If the 4th value in effectAuraStr is 89 (SPELL_AURA_PERIODIC_DAMAGE_PERCENT) I believe this is the percentage of health lost.
5.  string mitigationStr - comma separated string containing "aborb,block,resist" amounts
6.  int hitInfo - see below but generally 0 unless the spell was a crit in which case it will be 2
7.  int spellSchool - the damage school of the spell, see below
8.  string effectAuraStr - comma separated string containing the three spell effect numbers and the aura type (usually means a Dot but not all Dots will have an aura type) if applicable.  So "effect1,effect2,effect3,auraType"

Example (uses ace RegisterEvent):
```
Cursive:RegisterEvent("SPELL_DAMAGE_EVENT_SELF",
    function(targetGuidStr,
             casterGuidStr,
             spellId,
             amount,
             mitigationStr,
             hitInfo,
             spellSchool,
             effectAuraStr)
        print(targetGuidStr .. " " .. casterGuidStr .. " " .. tostring(spellId) .. " " .. tostring(amount) .. " " .. tostring(spellSchool) .. " " .. mitigationStr .. " " .. hitInfo .. " " .. effectAuraStr)
    end);
```

### Bug Reporting
If you encounter any bugs please report them in the issues tab.  Please include the nampower_debug.txt file in the same directory as your WoW.exe to help me diagnose the issue.  If you are able to reproduce the bug please include the steps to reproduce it.  In a future version once bugs are ironed out I'll make logging optional.

### FAQ & Additional Info

#### How does queuing work?
Trying to cast a spell within the appropriate window before your current spell finishes will queue your new spell.  
The spell will be cast as soon as possible after the current spell finishes.  

There are separate configurable queue windows for:
- Normal spells
- On swing spells (the window functions as a cooldown instead where you cannot immediately double queue on swing spells so that I don't have to track swing timers)
- Channeling spells
- Spells with terrain targeting

There are 3 separate queues for the following types of spells: GCD(max size:1), non GCD(max size:6), and on-hit(max size:1).

Additionally the queuing system will ignore spells with any of the following attributes/effects to avoid issues with tradeskills/enchants/other out of combat activities:
- SpellAttributes::SPELL_ATTR_TRADESPELL
- SpellEffects::SPELL_EFFECT_TRADE_SKILL
- SpellEffects::SPELL_EFFECT_ENCHANT_ITEM
- SpellEffects::SPELL_EFFECT_ENCHANT_ITEM_TEMPORARY
- SpellEffects::SPELL_EFFECT_CREATE_ITEM
- SpellEffects::SPELL_EFFECT_OPEN_LOCK
- SpellEffects::SPELL_EFFECT_OPEN_LOCK_ITEM

#### Why do I need a buffer?
From my own testing it seems that a buffer is required on spells to avoid "This ability isn't ready yet"/"Another action in progress" errors.  
By that I mean that if you cast a 1.5 second cast time spell every 1.5 seconds without your ping changing you will occasionally get
errors from the server and your cast will get rejected.  If you have 150ms+ ping this can be very punishing.

I believe this is related to the server tick during which incoming spells are processed.  There is logic to
subtract the server processing time from your gcd in vmangos but turtle does not appear to be doing this.

To compensate for what seems to be a 50ms server tick the default buffer in nampower.cfg is 55ms.  If you are close to the server
you can experiment with lowering this value.  You will occasionally get errors but if they are infrequent enough for you
the time saved will be worth it.

Non gcd spells also seem to be affected by this.  I suspect that only one spell can be processed per server tick.  
This means that if you try to cast 2 non gcd spells in the same server tick only one will be processed.  
To avoid this happening there is `NP_NonGcdBufferTimeMs` which is added after each non gcd spell.  There might be more to
it than this as using the normal buffer of 55ms was still resulting in skipped casts for me.  I found 100ms to be a safe value.

#### GCD Spells
Only one gcd spell can be queued at a time.  Pressing a new gcd spell will replace any existing queued gcd spell.

As of 5/13/2025 the server tick is now subtracted from the gcd timer so a buffer is no longer required for spells with a cast time at least ~50ms less than their gcd :)

#### Non GCD Spells
Non gcd spells have special handling.  You can queue up to 6 non gcd spells, 
and they will execute in the order queued with `NP_NonGcdBufferTimeMs` delay after each of them to help avoid server rejection.  
The non gcd queue always has priority over queued normal spells.  
You can only queue a given spellId once in the non gcd queue, any subsequent attempts will just replace the existing entry in the queue.

`NP_ReplaceMatchingNonGcdCategory` will cause non gcd spells with the same non zero StartRecoveryCategory to replace each other in the queue.  
The vast majority of spells not on the gcd have category '0' so it ignores them to avoid causing issues.  
One notable exception is shaman totems on TWoW that were changed to have separate categories according to their elements.

This can be useful if you want to change your mind about the non gcd spell you have queued.  For example, if you queue a mana potion and decide you want to use LIP instead last minute.

#### On hit Spells
Only one on hit spell can be queued at a time.  Pressing a new on hit spell will replace any existing queued on hit spell.  
On hit spells have no effect on the gcd or non gcd queues as they are handled entirely separately and are resolved by your auto attack.

#### Channeling Spells
Channeling spells function differently than other spells in that the channel in the client actually begins when you receive 
the CHANNEL_START packet from the server.  This means the client channel is happening 1/2 your latency after the server channel 
and that server tick delay is already included in the cast, whereas regular spells are the other way around (the client is ahead of the server).  

From my testing it seems that you can usually subtract your full latency from the end of the channel duration without losing
any ticks.  Since your latency can vary it is safer to do a percentage of your latency instead to minimize the chance of 
having a tick cut off.  This is controlled by the cvar `NP_ChannelLatencyReductionPercentage` which defaults to 75.

Channeling spells can be interrupted outside the channel queue window by casting any spell if `NP_InterruptChannelsOutsideQueueWindow` is set to 1.  During the channel queue window
you cannot interrupt the channel unless you turn off `NP_QueueChannelingSpells`.  You can always move to interrupt a channel at any time.

#### Spells on Cooldown
If using `NP_QueueSpellsOnCooldown` when you attempt to cast a spell that has a remaining cooldown of less than `NP_CooldownQueueWindowMs` it will be queued instead of failing with 'Spell not Ready Yet'.
There is a separate queue of size 1 for normal spells and non gcd spells.  If something is in either of these cooldown queues and you try to cast a spell that is not on cooldown it will be cast immediately and clear the appropriate cooldown queue.

For example, if Fire Blast is on cooldown and I queue it and then try to cast Fireball it will cast Fireball immediately and Fire Blast will not get automatically cast anymore.

This currently doesn't work for item cooldowns as they work differently, will add in the future.

#### NP_OptimizeBufferUsingPacketTimings
This feature will attempt to optimize your buffer on individual casts using your latency and server packet timings.  
After you begin to cast a spell you will get a cast result packet back from the server letting you know if the cast was successful.
The time between when you send your start cast packet and when you receive the cast result packet consists of:
- The time it takes for your packet to reach the server
- The time it takes for the server to process the packet (see Why do I need a buffer?)
- The time it takes for the server to send the result packet back to you
- Other delays I'm not sure about like the time it takes for the client to process packets from the server due to being single threaded

If we take this 'Spell Response Time' and subtract your regular latency from it, we should be able to get a rough idea of the time it
took for the server to process the cast.  If that time was less than your current default buffer we can use that time as the new buffer
for the next cast only.  In theory if it is more than your current buffer we should also use it, but in 
practice it seems to regularly be way larger than expected and using the default buffer doesn't result in an error.

Due to this delay varying wildly in testing I'm unsure how reliable this technique is.  It needs more testing
and a better understanding of all the factors introducing delay.  It is disabled by default for now.

# Pepo v1.0.0 Changes

Now looks for a nampower.cfg file in the same directory with two lines:

1.  The first line should contain the "buffer" time between each cast.  This is the amount of time to delay casts to ensure you don't try to cast again too early due to server/packet lag and get rejected by the server with a "This ability isn't ready yet" error.  For 150ms I found 30ms to be a reasonable buffer.
2.  The second line is the window in ms before each cast during which nampower will delay cast attempts to send them to the server at the perfect time.  So 300 would mean if you cast anytime in the 300ms window before your next optimal cast your cast will be sent at the idea time.  This means you don't have to spam cast as aggressively.  This feature will cause a small stutter because it is pausing your UI (I couldn't findSpellId a better way to do this but I'm sure one exists now with superwow) so if you don't like that set this to 0.

An auto stop-cast tool for World of Warcraft 1.12.1.5875 (for Windows)

There is a design flaw in this version of the client.  A player is not allowed to cast a
second spell until after the client receives word of the completion of the previous spell.
This means that in addition to the cast time, you have to wait for the time it takes a
message to arrive from the server.  For many U.S. based players connected to E.U. based
realms, this can result in approximately a 20% drop in effective DPS.

Consider the following timeline, assuming a latency of 200ms.

* t = 0, the player begins casting fireball (assume a cast time of one second or 1000ms)
       and spell cast message is sent to the server.  at this time, the client places
       a lock on itself, preventing the player from requesting another spell cast.
* t = 200, the spell cast message arrives at the server, and the spell cast begins
* t = 1200, the spell cast finishes and a finish message is sent to the client
* t = 1400, the client receives the finish message and removes the lock it had placed
          1400ms ago.
		  
In this scenario, a 1000ms spell takes 1400ms to cast.  This tool will work around that
design flaw by altering the client behavior to not wait for the server to acknowledge
anything.
